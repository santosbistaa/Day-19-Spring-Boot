Day 19 of Spring Boot: Advanced Validation in Spring MVC! <br>

Today’s Spring Boot journey was all about leveling up form validation! Here’s what I learned:  <br>

1) Number Range Validation: Ensured numbers fall within a specific range using `@Min` and `@Max`.  <br>
2) Regular Expressions: Applied regex patterns to validate complex input formats.  <br>
3) Required Integer Fields: Made integer fields mandatory with `@NotNull`.  <br>
4) Custom Error Messages: Added user-friendly messages for validation errors.  <br>
5) Debugging Tips: Learned how to debug and resolve custom error naming issues.
